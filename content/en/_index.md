      Miao Zhong is a Professor at the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University, a Researcher Fellow at the National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, and a Ph.D. Supervisor. He received Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo and B.S. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Tokyo, JSPS, NEDO, and the University of Toronto, focusing on small molecule activation, energy materials & devices, and catalytic material development.

      Prof. Zhong has been selected into the **National Youth Talent Program (Overseas, 2018)**, Jiangsu Shuangchuang Talent (2020), NJU Education–Research Integration Award (2022), the Young Scientist Award of the Japan Materials Research Society (2012), and the JSPS Fellowship (2011-2013). He has led two general-program grants from the NSFC, participated in one National Key R&D Project of MOST, and headed projects under the Jiangsu Carbon-Peak & Carbon-Neutrality S&T Special Program, the Jiangsu Shuangchuang Team, the Jiangsu Six Talent Peaks Program, and the NJU Dengfeng Talent Program.

      As first or corresponding author (responsible affiliation) he has published >60 papers in **Nature, Nat. Catal., Nat. Commun. (3), J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2), Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. (2), Energy Environ. Sci.**, etc., accumulating ~6,000 independent citations, with 11 papers cited >100 times. He has authored two English book chapters, edited one English monograph, and co-edited one Chinese textbook. He has transferred one U.S. patent to TotalEnergies, licensed one Japanese patent, and applied/granted several Chinese patents.

      Research Interests: electro-/thermo-catalytic conversion of CO2 and other small molecules, catalytic reaction kinetics, surface & interfacial physical chemistry. If you are interested in our research, please forward all inquiries to Prof. Zhong at miaozhong@nju.edu.cn.
